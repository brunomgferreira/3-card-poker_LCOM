# LCOM Project 2024 - 3 Card Poker

3 Card Poker is a casino game where the player places an initial bet, looks at their cards, and decides whether to continue playing or fold. The goal is to compete against the dealer to determine who has the better hand.

This project was developed in C for the MINIX operating system. In addition to developing the project, we were required to create an API to interact with the OS drivers.

Developed for the **Computer Laboratory (LCOM)** course unit **@FEUP**

Project grade: **18.23 / 20**
